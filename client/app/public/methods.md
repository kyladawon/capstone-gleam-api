For the API Design, we utilized a RESTful Architecture to ensure stateless communication, and used API keys for authentication. The API endpoints include simulation, compute management, machine learning, and data management endpoints (e.g., /original, /create_compute, /stnp_model).To ensure API security, we utilized API keys managed through Firestore, rate-limited to 10 requests/minute, future plans for HTTPS.We integrated the GLEAM model Integration. GLEAM is a spatial, stochastic epidemic simulation used to generate high-fidelity data for training our surrogate model. It takes in parameters like virus and population attributes; outputs are used for model training.The surrogate Model we trained is STNP model. It uses a Bayesian Active Learning framework to efficiently train on GLEAM simulation data, reducing computational cost.Bayesian Active Learning uses the latent information gain (LIG) function for selecting relevant data to improve model performance with fewer data points. The model predicts on datasets by splitting data into batches and processing them through the model for outputs. We calculated the estimated cost of API deployment on Google Cloud: ~$2.90/month for Compute Engine, Firestore, and API Gateway.For Stress Testing, we Assessed API performance under high traffic using polinux/stress Docker image for load simulation.
