**GLEAM Model Integration**:
Spatial, stochastic epidemic simulation uses real-world population and mobility data to generate high-fidelity data for training surrogate model.

**Bayesian Active Learning (BAL)**:
Uses latent information gain function to select relevant data, enhancing model performance with fewer data points.

**AI Surrogate Model**:
AI surrogate model uses BAL to optimize the amount of data needed to train down to 30% of data while achieving the same performance.
