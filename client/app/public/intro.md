Epidemics and pandemics present significant challenges to global health, emphasizing the need for advanced modeling and forecasting tools to minimize their impact. The **COVID-19 pandemic** highlighted the importance of real-time, data-driven epidemic simulation models to support rapid, informed decision-making by public health organizations.

Traditional models like the **Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM)** provide valuable insights by simulating disease spread across regions using population movement and transmission data. However, these models are computationally intensive, limiting their effectiveness for real-time applications.

**AI-driven surrogate models** offer a promising solution, reducing simulation time from weeks to days, and enabling quicker responses during health crises. Despite their potential, current AI models often rely on pre-simulated data, which is costly to store and lacks the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing disease dynamics.

This highlights the need for a **scalable, real-time epidemic simulation framework** that combines the strengths of traditional models with **AI-powered acceleration**.
