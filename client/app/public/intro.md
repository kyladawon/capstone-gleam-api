Epidemics and pandemics pose complex challenges to global health, requiring robust modeling and forecasting tools to mitigate their impact. The COVID-19 pandemic starkly illustrated the critical need for real-time, data-driven epidemic simulation models that enable public health organizations to make informed, rapid-response decisions. Traditional epidemic simulators, such as the GLEAM, play a central role in this effort by simulating disease spread across regions using data on population movement and disease transmission rates. While effective for large-scale scenario testing, these models are limited in their adaptability for real-time applications
